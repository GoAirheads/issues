### GoAirheads Shared Account

You can use the GoAirheads shared staff account stored on the computers, but **make sure to put your name in the issue or bug report**.

You can **only create _new_ issues** using the GoAirheads-staff account. Your name should be added like this: `Reporter: Ethan`

## Bug and Error Reports

When reporting BUGS that shouldn't happen and should be fixed, please immediately create a [new issue here](https://github.com/GoAirheads/issues/issues/new/choose).

Try and include as much info as you can. Thanks!

## Making feature suggestions

When making feature suggestions, [create a new discussion first](https://github.com/GoAirheads/issues/discussions/new), unless Josh, Ethan, or another authorized programming lead says so.
Then your discussion will be moved to, or you can create, [a new issue](https://github.com/GoAirheads/issues/issues).
